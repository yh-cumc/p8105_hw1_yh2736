# question 1, create a data frame

``` r
# dataset of question 1 ques1_data_set including 4 variable: random sample, logical vector, character vector
# and factor vector

ques1_data_set = tibble(
  rand_size8_sd = rnorm(8),    # random sample
  log_vect = rand_size8_sd > 0, # logical vector
  char_vect_len8 = c("male", "female", "male", "male", "female", "male", "male", "female"),  # character vector
  fac_len8_lev3 = factor(c("low", "high", "middle", "middle", "low", "low", "high", "middle")) # factor vector
)
```

  - the mean of variable 1 the mean of variable rand\_size8\_sd of
    dataset is 0.2512689;

  - the mean of variable 2 the mean of variable log\_vect of dataset is
    0.625;

  - the mean of variable 3 the mean of variable char\_vect\_len8 of
    dataset is NA;

  - the mean of variable 4 the mean of variable fac\_len8\_lev3 of
    dataset is NA;
