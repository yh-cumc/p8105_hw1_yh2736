# question 1

## code chunk1: create a data frame

``` r
# dataset of question 1 ques1_data_set including 4 variable: random sample, logical vector, character vector
# and factor vector

ques1_data_set = tibble(
  rand_size8_sd = rnorm(8),    # random sample
  log_vect = rand_size8_sd > 0, # logical vector
  char_vect_len8 = c("male", "female", "male", "male", "female", "male", "male", "female"),  # character vector
  fac_len8_lev3 = factor(c("low", "high", "middle", "middle", "low", "low", "high", "middle")) # factor vector
)
```

  - the mean of variable 1 the mean of variable rand\_size8\_sd of
    dataset is 0.6955212;

  - the mean of variable 2 the mean of variable log\_vect of dataset is
    0.875;

  - the mean of variable 3 the mean of variable char\_vect\_len8 of
    dataset is NA;

  - the mean of variable 4 the mean of variable fac\_len8\_lev3 of
    dataset is
NA;

## code chunk2: variable convert

``` r
# convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random samble by the resule
rand_mul_numeric_of_log = ques1_data_set$rand_size8_sd * as.numeric(ques1_data_set$log_vect)

# convert the logical vector to factor, and multiply the random samble by the resule
rand_mul_factor_of_log = ques1_data_set$rand_size8_sd * as.factor(ques1_data_set$log_vect)
```

    ## Warning in Ops.factor(ques1_data_set$rand_size8_sd,
    ## as.factor(ques1_data_set$log_vect)): '*' not meaningful for factors

``` r
# convert the logical vector to factor,and then convert the result to numberic, 
# and multiply the random samble by the resule
rand_mul_numeric_of_factor_of_log = ques1_data_set$rand_size8_sd * as.numeric(as.factor(ques1_data_set$log_vect))
```

  - convert the logical vector to numeric, and multiply the random
    samble by the resule, output is 0.9684893, 1.9653678, 0.8863225,
    0.0305403, 0.9495574, 0, 0.7215234, 0.6190989

  - convert the logical vector to factor, and multiply the random samble
    by the resule, output is NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA

  - convert the logical vector to factor,and then convert the result to
    numberic, and multiply the random samble by the resule. output is
    1.9369786, 3.9307356, 1.7726451, 0.0610805, 1.8991148, -0.57673,
    1.4430467, 1.2381978

# question 2

## chunk 1: setup data frame

``` r
## data frame with 5 variable
ques2_data_set = tibble(
  x = rnorm(500),   # random sample of size 500 from a standard normal distribution
  y = rnorm(500),   # random sample of size 500 from a standard normal distribution
  log_vect_larger_than_one = (x + y) > 1,   #logical vector indicating which X+y>1
  num_vect = as.numeric(log_vect_larger_than_one),   # A numeric vector created by coercing the above logical vector
  fact_vect = as.factor(log_vect_larger_than_one)    # A factir vector crated by coercing the above logical vector
)
```

  - THe size of dataset is 2500
  - The mean, median, and standard deviation of X are -0.0491305,
    -0.0432709 and 1.0211334
  - The proportion of cases of for which x+y \> 1 is 21.2%
